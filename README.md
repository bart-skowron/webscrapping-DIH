# webscrapping-DIH
**Digital Innovation Hubs** are one-stop-shops that help companies to become more competitive with regard to their business/production processes, products or services using digital technologies. They are based upon technology infrastructure (Competence Centre - CC) and provide access to the latest knowledge, expertise and technology to support their customers with piloting, testing and experimenting with digital innovations. DIHs also provide business and financing support to implement these innovations, if needed across the value chain. As proximity is considered crucial, they act as a first regional point of contact, a doorway, and strengthen the innovation ecosystem. 

In my exercise I scrapped the website of the European Commission to collect data on all 650+ DIHs. Subsequently, I cleaned the data and visualized it. The visualization was carried out in 3 step process:
- share of DIHs in total population with a given technology/service/market/TLR;
- share of countries with at least one DIH with a given technology/service/market/TLR;
- coverage - number of DIHs with a given number of technology/service/market/TLR features.
